		<p align="center" style= font-family:'Serif';>The United States of America’s criminal justice system is broken, and has been broken for as long as we could remember. <br> With hate crimes across the nation, people of color, including African Americans and Latinos, are of the first to be targeted by police officers. <br> Among them is the country they live in, the United States of America.<br> With the most prisoners in the world, accounting to 25% of the world’s population, here are some statistics on criminal injustice in the United States... </p>
		<ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
			<li> Of all crimes that happen in our country, only ten percent of them are reported.</li>
			<li> More African-Americans are in the prison system than there were slaves in the 1850s.</li>
			<li> One in fifteen African-American men are behind bars. </li>
			<li> One in thirteen African-Americans are no longer able to vote, being that they were once imprisoned. </li>
			<li> The “War on Drugs” has mostly affected those of color, imprisoning more Hispanic and African-American drug users compared to their Caucasian counterparts.</li>
			<li> People of color are more likely to be searched during traffic stops, with Hispanics being searched 7% of the time and African-Americans being searched 6% of the time.</li>
			<li> Black youth is twice as likely to be arrested for crimes in school compared to the white youth.</li>
			<li> African-Americans are more likely to be sentenced to serious prison time, whereas their Caucasian counterparts do community service.</li>
			<li> African-Americans are more likely to be detained and to wait for a trial compared to whites.</li>
			<li> One in six Latino men are expected to be imprisoned once in their lifetime in the United States.</li>
			<li> 1 in 111 white women are expected to be imprisoned once in their lifetime in the United States, compared to 1 in 18 for black women. </li>
			<li> It costs nearly $100,000+ to incarcerate a single person, every year, with US taxpayers paying nearly $70 billion a year to maintain the prison system. </li>
			<li> Nearly 77% of prisoners are rearrested within five years in the United States, having one of the highest recidivism rates.</li>
